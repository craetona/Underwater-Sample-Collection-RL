# CS499-Final-Project
Final Project for CS499
[Sample collection]
An underwater robot is tasked with collecting samples from the ocean bed.
The robot can move in all four directions, collect and deposit samples.
The robot is rewarded if it can deposit the sample at a testing site.
The robot’s battery has limited power and the robot cannot continue operation if the battery level is low or zero.
For the purpose of this project, we will assume that the region of interest in the ocean bed is a 10x10 grid.
The robot’s initial location, location of the sample and the test sites are known and are distinct.
There are certain regions with high tides and the robot must exert extra pressure to remain stable in these regions, which drains its battery faster.
