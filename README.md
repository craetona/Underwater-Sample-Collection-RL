# Underwater Sample Collection RL
Final Project for CS499
[Sample collection]
An underwater robot is tasked with collecting samples from the ocean bed. The robot can move in four directions, collect, and deposit samples.
The robot is rewarded if it can deposit the sample at a testing site.
The robot’s battery has limited power and cannot continue operating if the battery level is low or zero.
The region of interest in the ocean bed is a 10x10 grid. The robot’s initial location, the location of samples, and the test site are known and distinct.
There are certain regions with high tides, and the robot must exert extra power to remain stable in these regions, draining its battery faster.
